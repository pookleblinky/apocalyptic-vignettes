The world is the primary player character's location. The characters are the
players themselves. The bulk of choice about worldbuilding is therefore in the
choice of zombies used. Here's a few good ones. Since the game starts at hour
zero, some of the finer points of these various types won't really show up.

# Newsflesh zombies

Seanan McGuire's Kellis-Amberlee zombies. Everyone's infected, everyone turns.
Any mammals over 40lbs can turn. People can spontaneously turn. Shamblers, which
appear to hunt in packs.

# Joe McKinney zombies

Joe McKinney's Dead City series zombies. Shamblers, spreading infection via
bites. The infected bite kills within an hour. Highly sensitive to noise. 

# John O'Brian Zombies

John O'Brien's New World zombies. Fast-moving infected, allergic to sunlight,
extremely good sense of smell and hearing.

# Classic Romero zombies

You know these zombies.

# 28 Days Later Zombies

You know these guys too.
