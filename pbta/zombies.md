The world is the primary player character's location. The characters are the
players themselves. The bulk of choice about world-building is therefore in the
choice of zombies used. Here's a few good ones. Since the game starts at hour
zero, some of the finer points of these various types won't really show up. For
instance, Joe McKinney's zombies eventually become pack predators able to hunt
prey strategically, but only after several months.

# Newsflesh zombies

Seanan McGuire's Kellis-Amberlee zombies. Everyone's infected, everyone turns.
Any mammals over 40lbs can turn. People can spontaneously turn. Shamblers, which
appear to hunt in packs.

Exposure to body fluids (such as, say, aresolized blood after bludgeoning a
zombie's head in an enclosed area), can cause viral amplification. A GM hard
move in combat can definitely be that you succeed in decapitating the zombie
beautifully, but inhale a good whiff of enough infected particles that you're
about 2 minutes from turning. 

If players aren't aware they're dealing with this, they're almost certainly
gonna die soon (read her Last Stand of the San Diego Browncoats to see this in
action).

# Joe McKinney zombies

Joe McKinney's Dead City series zombies. Shamblers, spreading infection via
bites. The infected bite kills within an hour. Highly sensitive to noise. 

A bite quickly turns infected, rapidly causing gangrene and fever and pulminary
edema. Very soon the infected person is no longer mobile and shows significant
cognitive disability. 

# John O'Brian Zombies

John O'Brien's New World zombies. Fast-moving infected, allergic to sunlight,
extremely good sense of smell and hearing.

# Classic Romero zombies

You know these zombies.

# 28 Days Later Zombies

You know these guys too.
