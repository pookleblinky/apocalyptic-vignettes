# General system

Read the Dungeon World Guide and the Simple World guide to get an idea of the
basic system being used, and the links at the bottom. Powered by the Apocalypse
is an extremely flexible system, rather light in crunchiness, and encodes good
GM habits right into its rules. Most of this should make sense to some degree. 

You, as the GM, have an agenda, a set of principles that determine your actions
(not a pre-made narrative), and a limited number of moves that the players
trigger through their actions. 

# Stats used:

- Cool: reflexive/graceful
- Hot: persuasive/assertive
- Reckless: aggressive/forceful
- McGuyver: calculating/methodical
- Genre Savviness: Inquisitive/exploratory

# Agenda:

- Make the Apocalypse feel real.
- Make the character's lives interesting.
- Play to find out what happens.
- Make things more chaotic and dangerous over time.

# Principles (right from the quickstart guide):

- Barf forth apocalyptica.
- Make the world seem real.
- Build a bigger world through play.
- Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
- Address yourself to the characters, not the players.
- Start and end your moves with the fiction.
- Make your move, but misdirect.
- Make your move, but never speak its name.
- Look at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs.
- Name everyone, make everyone human. Even the zombies.
- Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
- Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
- Be a fan of the players’ characters. They'll need one.
- Think offscreen, too.
- Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.
- Make the players' characters feel overwhelmed and confused
- Make the players' characters *not* feel like the protagonist

# Moves (from quickstart guide):

- Separate them.
- Put them together.
- Put someone in a high-stakes situation.
- Trade harm for harm (as established).
- Deal harm (as established).
- Announce off-screen badness.
- Announce future badness.
- Take away one of their Things.
- Demonstrate one of their Things’ bad sides.
- Give them a difficult decision to make.
- Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Make a move from one of your Dangers or Bigger Pictures.

# Dangers and Bigger Pictures

Instead of just defined Dangers and a Bigger Picture, characters can get
information about the world from their phones, tv's they pass, etc. This is done
via a lookup table. They roll a die, and you announce what they saw or heard.

A minimal way to do this is to ask them to roll a d4 to determine which of 4
categories of news they'll get.

1. Reports of violence.
2. Reports of destruction.
3. Strange news.
4. Messsages from family and friends.

Larger dice can be used to give more granularity. In keeping with the Agenda and
Principles, these snippets should give evocative glimpses of a world falling
apart, and *not* give the players the sense that there is much if anything they
can do about it. What is a player supposed to do with a livestream of a police
car crashing into a crowd of people? Play to find out.

PBtA has a clock mechanism, but in this game there is no easily defined danger
to trigger: everything, everywhere, is getting chaotic and more dangerous. It
can be added in if wanted: say, a timer til the local hospital is overrun or
such.

Some Fronts that you could use: local police response, national
military/emergency response, etc. Unlike in the Sprawl, where you can alert
organization threat clocks with your actions though, odds are you're going to be
a drop in the bucket of all the chaos going on. These threat clocks will need
some other mechanism for advancing. Maybe in-game units of time? Try it.
