In Apocalyptic Vignettes, you play yourself. And I have no idea what things
you're good at. So, I can't really offer you a playbook and say "hey, you're a
Cleric" or "hey, you're a Gunlugger" and give you a bunch of custom moves.

Players should come up with their custom moves together in session 0. Just
bounce ideas back and forth and I guarantee you'll have some fun figuring out
how you're oddly equipped to handle the zombie apocalypse.

In addition to the basic moves in playermoves.md, you can make up to 3 custom
moves. Don't know what they should be? Here's some move ideas that could help.

- Works in Retail. You're used to being in dangerous environments even before
the zombies showed up. Roll+Cool.

- Parental Blues. You've got a kid, if you can get them to eat veggies you can
  do anything. Roll+Hot

- Not a Morning Person. You're dealing with the end of the world before your
  morning coffee. Roll+Reckless

- Youtube Came in Handy. You've binged on countless how to videos about this
  subject that suddenly seems relevant in the zombie apocalypse. What is it?
  Roll+McGuyver

- Bub Lover. You've got every Romero film memorized, and strong opinions about
  fast moving zombies. Roll+Genre-Savviness.

- Oddly high in one stat? Make a move that lets you use that stat in place of
  the stat used in a normal basic move: maybe you can roll +Cool instead of
  Reckless on Go Medieval on it due you your Wing Chun classes.

- You carry your multitool everywhere. +1 on McGuyver.
