In normal PBtA games, tags are used to provide largely in-fiction markers for
how things act. A chainsaw is Loud Messy Near: it's very loud, it'll cause a lot
of gore, and is only useful for attacking things nearby. It may be a 3 Harm Loud
Messy, indicating a mechanic: it causes 3 harm on successful attack.

This works in games where there's a limited and defined inventory of things.
Apocalyptic Vignettes, however, you play as yourself in a world that up til a
few seconds ago was the real world. Tags become a bit messier than in fictional
worlds where you could be handed a 2 Harm Baseball Bat. 

I think tags are there as a guide to help the fiction along. It's useful to know
this sword is +3 Flaming Messy Quick, if you've never used a flaming sword
capable of cutting a horse in half with one slice. It informs the fiction in a
world where you're probably not going to ignore the sword and instead try to
bludgeon a baddie with the horse instead. In Apocalyptic Vignettes, there
shouldn't be such a need to front-load the fiction like that.

My lazy solution: don't bother defining tags until they're needed in game. If
someone throws a watermelon at a zombie, the fiction will inform the tags for
next time. If that happens often enough, sure, go ahead and add tags explicitly
in a tags file.
