The thing I'm going for is the chaos of the first few minutes and hours of the
zombie apocalypse. No overarching narrative, no time to plan or even process
much. The narrative has to relentlessly drive the player to survive the next few
minutes, as things turn to shit by the second.

In the beginning, it may be possible to drive miles before having to roll
anything. Before long, just crossing an open window's gonna require a risk
Detection roll. The world will rapidly become much more dangerous.

Another big thing is realism. There should be as little need for the player to
extrapolate from themselves as possible. If they can't pick locks, their
character can't. If they can't sew, their character can't. Stats have to make
sense in the context of actual humans. The player knows how strong they are, but
I guarantee they can't put a number on it. They shouldn't have to try to
correlate their knowledge of how much they can carry with an arbitrary and
abstract number. When in doubt, make it easy for the player to play as
themselves.
