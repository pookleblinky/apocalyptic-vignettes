# The basics

To do it, do it. When what you're doing triggers a move, you'll be asked to
roll 2d6 plus a modifier.

10+: success
7-9: success at a cost ("here's three options. Pick two.")
6-: failure, and the GM pulls a Hard Move.

# Basic moves

All PC's have some basic moves they can do.

- Risk It All, relevant stat. When you have to ignore danger to accomplish
  something. 
- Go Medieval, Reckless. When you do a violence against an enemy.
- Check it Out, Cool. When searching a room, etc. This isn't just
  looking, it's wandering around and such.
- Hack it, McGuyver. When you try to repair or build something.
- Persuade, Cool (or Genre-savviness where appropriate). When you persuade
  someone of something, or try to convince them that your genre-savvy plan is
  safer.
- Intimidate, Hot. When you intimidate another person.
- Read a person, Cool. When you try to assess another person.

Certain items in possession can add modifiers to these rolls. If you have a
weapon, you may add +1 to an Intimidate roll, for instance. If you're trying to
fix something, having an appropriate tool could add a +1. 

Certain rolls can confer a forward modifier. If you roll +10 on Defy Danger,
your next action could get a +1 modifier added to it, for instance. Whereas if
you fail, not only will the GM make a hard move but you could get a -1 modifier
for whatever you were trying to do next.
