When in doubt, it should be easy for the player to play themselves.

The player should not have to expend much effort trying to fit their knowledge
of themselves into arbitrary numbers. They know how strong or quick they are,
even if no glowing number is on their forehead describing that.

I'm inclined to have minimal stats, all of which are as intuitive as possible to
map to one's own self-knowledge. A player who deadlifts should be pretty
confident saying they've got a strength of "around N"

Stats are in categories:

combat 
social
mental
survival
genre savviness
Cool

Survival: encompasses everything from whether they've watched a lot of youtube
videos about lifehacks, to experience with fixing stuff or taking first aid
courses, etc.

Genre savviness: they know about zombies, obviously. They know how much they
know about zombies. 

Cool: catchall
