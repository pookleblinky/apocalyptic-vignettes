# Moves

Everyone can do something, but you have a particular set of skills. Pick
three, corresponding to one of your stats. Do you watch a lot of youtube videos
about lifehacks and such? Go ahead and make a move that uses your McGuyver stat.

When in doubt, remember that you are playing yourself. If you claim you can pick
locks, you're gonna have to convince everyone else that you've done more than
watch a youtube video about it.

This is not D&D, you don't get to just say "I roll strength" or such. You don't
have to worry about what move is being triggered, that's the GM's job. You just
have to describe what your character is doing. 

Moves aren't triggered by everything. You don't have to roll dice to check your
pockets or such. They're triggered when you can *fail interestingly*. Many
things you do, you'll succeed at automatically as expected and there's no reason
to roll. Sometimes, circumstances mean that success isn't guaranteed. That is
when a move will be triggered. 

Here are some moves everyone can do:

- Defy Danger, relevant stat
- Fight, Reckless
- Examine stuff thoroughly, Cool
- Make/fix something, McGuyver
- Do something through stress, Hot
- Persuade, Cool
- Intimidate, Hot
- Read a person, Cool

Possible others:

- Negotiate, Cool

Hm. What move would use Genre Savviness? I think it'd work well with custom
moves.

- Convince people of the threat they face, Genre Savviness. Roll to see how well
  you can convince others that you are actually facing zombies. A 6- can mean
  not only do you fail to convince them, but they try to convince *you* that
  zombies don't exist. Their proof will probably end in gore.
