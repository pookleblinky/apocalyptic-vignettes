Ok, so in PBTA players can trigger moves.

Some possible basic moves:

- risk detection
- melee
- stunt drive
- mcguyver
- persuade
- intimidate
-
-
-

In addition, each player can make up three moves that they can do specifically,
based on their stats. If someone's got a high Genre Savviness stat, they could
make such as Stealth: when doing something related to stealth, add +1 using
Genre Savviness. Maybe one's watched a lot of youtube videos and has a high
McGuyver, their special moves may include Duct Tape Wizardry and Electrical
Safety, or such.

Player: ok, so I need to get to the kitchen without letting it notice me from
the living room. That's a risk detection, and... *rolls* I got a 7. I think they
can hear better than they see, especially in this light, so I'll slowly but
silently cross the door.


Player: I use the duct tape to tape a knife to the end of the baseball bat.

GM: That's not only mcguyvering, roll plus blah

Conditional successes

risk Detection: hide from one enemy but be noticeable to another, reduce one way
of being detected but increase another, etc

melee: choose between attack or take damage, choose which attack to be exposed
to

Stunt drive: Choose which obstacle to avoid, choose between taking damage to the
vehicle or going more cautiously but slower

Mcguyver: choose which material to waste

etc.

Player: so I barrel the car over the curb to avoid the wreckage

GM: That's stunt driving, roll 2d6 + blah

Player: 8

GM: you can get past the wreck but you're gonna have to scrape up against the
parked van or try to squeeze past the side of the house. What do you do?

The GM's agenda, other than the core PBtA agenda, is to make things both
chaotic, and *increasingly fucked*. 

Some standard GM moves:

- Reveal new danger
- Increase danger
- Cause unintended effect
- Threaten ally instead
- Make them sacrifice something
- Make them choose two options
- Damage something they own
- Embarass them with a mishap
- Have a new enemy target them
- Have them stumble, drop something
- Make location/position less safe
- Miss something important
- Add new environmental hazard
- Tell them the consequences of a move and ask
- Reveal a fundamental scarcity
- They're confused, dazed, deaf, blinded, etc.

All of these make sense, but the players' world is rapidly turning to shit.
Sooner or later, almost everything they do will risk being detected, everywhere
they look will reveal a threat. They could roll more often, or there could be
custom rules, or such, but the GM has to *continually make things more
dangerous*.
