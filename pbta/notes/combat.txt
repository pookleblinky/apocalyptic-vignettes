In real life, people are incredibly squishy and just terrible at violence. Most
fights end in a few seconds, many with someone going to an ER with a terrible
head injury just from falling on the ground, etc.

The player almost certainly isn't very good at violence, resisting the
adrenaline surge of violence. Odds are, they can barely throw a decent punch.

Since the player is playing themselves, their character should be really, really
hesitant about getting in a fight. 

I'm not gonna divide violence into subtypes, like Hack n Slash versus Volley, or
Melee versus Shooting, because look at youtube videos of real life fights. 99%
look like people angrily hugging each other for a few seconds. Fighting will be
fighting, and it's something the player should absolutely dread.

That said, how should zombies be statted?
