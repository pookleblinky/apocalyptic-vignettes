Normally, the PPC plays in their exact location. The game starts where they are,
with what they're wearing, right then.

Doing this all the time can get boring, as each game they'd have roughly the
same priorities and do roughly the same things.

It's worth thinking of some scenarios to throw at the players, with an emphasis
on reducing the amount of extrapolation necessary for them to play their
characters.

In End of the World, there's scenarios where the players are themselves running
the Boston Marathon, or on a cruise ship, or on a hiking trip or such. These can
be fun, but they still require more of a stretch that what I'd like to be doing.

So, some scenarios I think would be interesting:

- You're grocery shopping at your usual supermarket
- You're stuck in traffic on the way to work
- You're at the movie theatre
- You're at a festival or something you attend every year

etc. Places other than one's current location, but which the player can pretty
easily envision without much extrapolation (versus, "You win a trip to the
Bahamas, and step off the plane to find a driver waiting for you").
