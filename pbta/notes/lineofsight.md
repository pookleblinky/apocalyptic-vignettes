The BLIT module obviously requires a line of sight mechanic. The problem is that
they seem really clunky, tedious, and overly mechanical. It's painful to watch
such as Outbreak: Undead which has a field of view mechanic. In one AP I saw of
it, it took over a minute per move for characters to be able to figure out what
they could see and what could see them. Also, too dependent on Roll20. 

For me, the most important part of a POV mechanic is that it's lightweight and
fast. It should absolutely not rely on constant perception checks or dice rolls,
it shouldn't require having lightcones and minis, etc. I'd really prefer it to
not rely on an Awareness stat that must be beaten by a dice roll.

So, what's the PBtA-ish narrative-first POV mechanic? How do you trigger the
Exposure to a BLIT move without relying on perception checks and adversarial
dice rolls and carefully rendered mini maps?

# Blades in the Dark style positioning

BitD uses positioning to constrain how Hard a move the GM can make on a failed
roll. In PBtA, the GM is free to make a move as hard as they want if the PC
fails a roll. in BitD, the hardest move a GM can make depends on how risky the
move was. If the player fails a roll for a Desperate move, the GM *has* to hurt
them, but they can't do that if the situation is Guaranteed.

So: certain areas are going to be more risky than others. If a PC fails a move
in a risky area, the GM *has* to trigger the Exposure to BLIT move.
