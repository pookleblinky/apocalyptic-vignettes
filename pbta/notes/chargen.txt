When in doubt, it should be easy for the player to play themselves.

The player should not have to expend much effort trying to fit their knowledge
of themselves into arbitrary numbers. They know how strong or quick they are,
even if no glowing number is on their forehead describing that.

I'm inclined to have minimal stats, all of which are as intuitive as possible to
map to one's own self-knowledge. A player who deadlifts should be pretty
confident saying they've got a strength of "around N"

Canonical stats: 
- Reflexive/graceful: Cool
- Persuasive/assertive:  Hot
- Aggressive/forceful: Hard
- Calculating/methodical: Sharp
- Inquisitive/exploratory: Weird


I'd say Weird should be Genre Savviness, so

Cool
Hot
Hard
Sharp
Genre Savviness

I don't like "Sharp", so Mcguyver

Cool 
Hot 
Hard
McGuyver
Genre Savviness

I don't like "hard," so Reckless

Cool
Hot
Reckless
McGuyver
Genre Savviness

Which is good enough. Should be easy to explain how these stats interact and
contribute to things.

And the Relationships stat.
