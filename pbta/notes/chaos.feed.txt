I was trying to figure out how to add a clock mechanic to allow for the world
around the characters to gradually turn to shit.

I settled on the idea of a lookup table for news.

Realistically in a disaster, you'd be checking your phone constantly, looking at
the news on any passing tv, etc.

Characters can check their phones. GM could say, "why don't you check twitter?"

Player rolls a d20, and GM confers with a lookup table to tell them what they're
seeing.

Maybe it rolls a 16, the GM tells them about seeing tweets with livestreams of a
riot going on near the hospital.

Later on they roll a 16 again, they're seeing the riot's spread.

Maybe they roll a 7, and see that the bridge is blocked with traffic. A fire has
broken out downtown. Etc.

Glimpses of shit going down, basically. No firmly defined PBtA Danger, but a
whole bunch of bits and pieces of things that are falling apart in the world
around them.

a d100 would work even more nicely to present tiny things.

Let's start small. A d4, just 4 general categories of things that are going on. 

1. Reports of violence. Livestreams of fights, viral tweet about cops showing
up, etc.

2. Reports of destruction. Traffic jams, fires, etc

3. Reports of strangeness. News that is not necessarily violent or destructive,
but just weird. A facebook message talking about the gas station being closed, a
tweet joking about seeing a naked guy running, etc.

4. Reports from acquaintances. Text messages, facebook messages, tweets, etc
from people the character knows, generally containing aspects of the above 3
categories but not necessarily. A text message asking about dinner, a tweet
asking about what they just saw is going on near you, etc.
