A module for people who don't like zombies.

Read David Langford's [BLIT](https://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm).
Seriously, go read it and then come back.

Procedurally generated mind-destroying images, weaponized in every medium
capable of displaying them. They can be spraypainted on subway station walls,
flashed on webpages in the form of banner ads, embroidered on the backs of
hoodies and jackets, etc.

Within a second of seeing one, your visual processing center short-circuits. You
fall, frothing and seizing to the ground in a grand mal seizure. Maybe you catch
only a partial glimpse of one, and it melts part of your mind away, causing a
random aphasia or agnosia. 

Cool stuff.

# Setting

You are going about a perfectly normal day, and decided to stop at a Starbucks
for coffee. 

You have no idea that in about 5 minutes, a BLIT will be injected into the wifi
network to be exposed to everyone looking at a website. Most will go into
violent seizures. Some may start biting their own hands. A few may throw their
phones to the ground and launch themselves mouth-first at the nearest person.

You order a coffee. Tick.

You see a person you know and sit down next to them. Tick.

You engage in some small talk, etc. Tick.

And then the screaming starts.

# BLIT Move

When a BLIT is in your field of view, roll+Cool.

- 10+: You saccade past it, or it's temporarily obscured. You don't get
  affected.
- 7-9: You catch a partial glimpse of it. Pick one aphasia, agnosia, or delusion
  from the list.
- 6-: You see the BLIT well enough for it to paint your cerebral cortex. The GM
  can make a move.

TODO: Make a list of agnosias/aphasias
