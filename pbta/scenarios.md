Here's some scenarios to use. Remember, when in doubt make a scenario that
requires as little extrapolation as possible for the player. The player should
be able to easily picture themselves in that location.

# Default scenario: right here, right now

The game takes place at the primary player's exact location, with whatever they
have on them.

# Out shopping

The game takes place in a supermarket or store the primary player goes to, maybe
a coffee shop or such.

# Commuting

The game takes place during the primary player's commute, in a car or on a
subway or whatever.

# Date night

The game takes place at a restaurant, movie theatre, concert, or such. 

# Office space

The game takes place while at the primary player's workplace.

# Out sick

The game takes place in the primary player's hospital ER room. The backstory for
why they're there should be boring.
