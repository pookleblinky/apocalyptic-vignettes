# General System

Read the Dungeon World Guide and Simple World Guide to get a grasp of the system
used. Powered by the Apocalypse is a very flexible system, designed entirely
around players constructing the narrative as they play. The GM is there to make
things interesting, but the players are the ones who build the story.

# Stats

You have 5 stats, which can range from -1 to +2. These stats are added onto a
2d6 roll as modifiers. Don't overthink these. 

- Cool
- Hot
- Reckless
- McGuyver
- Genre Savviness

# Moves

Everyone can do something, but you have a particular set of skills. Pick
three, corresponding to one of your stats. Do you watch a lot of youtube videos
about lifehacks and such? Go ahead and make a move that uses your McGuyver stat.

When in doubt, remember that you are playing yourself. If you claim you can pick
locks, you're gonna have to convince everyone else that you've done more than
watch a youtube video about it.

This is not D&D, you don't get to just say "I roll strength" or such. You don't
have to worry about what move is being triggered, that's the GM's job. You just
have to describe what your character is doing. 

Moves aren't triggered by everything. You don't have to roll dice to check your
pockets or such. They're triggered when you can *fail interestingly*. Many
things you do, you'll succeed at automatically as expected and there's no reason
to roll. Sometimes, circumstances mean that success isn't guaranteed. That is
when a move will be triggered.

Here are some moves everyone can do:

- Defy Danger, relevant stat. 
- Melee, Reckless
- Examine stuff thoroughly, Cool
- Do something through stress, Hot
- Persuade, Cool
- Intimidate, Hot
- Read a person, Cool

In D&D, there's a tendency for players to become murderhobos, just killing
everything they see. D&D gives you a reward for doing so: you get to roll dice
and loot and such. PBtA removes that reward: you don't roll dice to decide if
your attempt to backstab an innocent old woman succeeds or not. You're a burly
barbarian with a sword, she's a peasant and someone's grandma. Of course you
succeed, you monster. PBtA deprives the would-be murderhobo of the reward of
rolling dice, that dopamine kick from a successful gamble. Your barbarian just
does a murder and steals the withered potato she was bringing home for her
starving grandchild. You monster.

# Harm Clock

Odds are, you don't know your pulse right now, or what your VO2 stat is. Odds
are, you have no idea how to tell you've broken a rib or punctured a spleen. So,
it's not realistic to have a solid number of hitpoints.

Instead, you get an abstraction, a harm clock. Every time you're hurt, the clock
fills up a little, and every time you heal it backs down a bit. Think of it this
way: in real life, a toothache can kill you. A cat bite can paralyze your arm.
Falling off a bike can rupture your kidney. You generally don't know exactly how
fucked up you are, but you can usually tell that you're more fucked up than
you were a few minutes earlier.

You're playing yourself, and you are *extremely* squishy in real life. Try not
to get hurt.
