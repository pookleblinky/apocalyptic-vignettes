# General System

Read the Dungeon World Guide and Simple World Guide to get a grasp of the system
used. Powered by the Apocalypse is a very flexible system, designed entirely
around players constructing the narrative as they play. The GM is there to make
things interesting, but the players are the ones who build the story.
