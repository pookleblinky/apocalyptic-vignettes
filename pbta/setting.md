Apocalyptic Vignettes takes place right here, right now. Your character is you:
they know everything you know, have seen all the movies you've seen, etc.

Your character is in the middle of your normal routine, when the Apocalypse
happens. There is no reason to suspect zombies, though since you're playing a
zombie game obviously that may cross your mind. All you see is a woman
screaming, running from a guy who seems to have just punched her in the parking
lot of your supermarket.

In other words, everything starts out normal and mundane and boring. There are
no portents, no suspicions that things are already falling apart, because IRL
you aren't seeing reports of a zombie apocalypse.

All that changes, quickly. Your normal routine is interrupted by a glimpse of
hell, and things rapidly snowball.
