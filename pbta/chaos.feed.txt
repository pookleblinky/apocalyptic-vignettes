I was trying to figure out how to add a clock mechanic to allow for the world
around the characters to gradually turn to shit.

I settled on the idea of a lookup table for news.

Realistically in a disaster, you'd be checking your phone constantly, looking at
the news on any passing tv, etc.

Characters can check their phones. GM could say, "why don't you check twitter?"

Player rolls a d20, and GM confers with a lookup table to tell them what they're
seeing.

Maybe it rolls a 16, the GM tells them about seeing tweets with livestreams of a
riot going on near the hospital.

Later on they roll a 16 again, they're seeing the riot's spread.

Maybe they roll a 7, and see that the bridge is blocked with traffic. A fire has
broken out downtown. Etc.

Glimpses of shit going down, basically. No firmly defined PBtA Danger, but a
whole bunch of bits and pieces of things that are falling apart in the world
around them.

a d100 would work even more nicely to present tiny things.
