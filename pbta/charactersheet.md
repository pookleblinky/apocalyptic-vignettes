# Harm

Draw an empty clock. Make a line from center to: 12, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11. Basically
split into quarters, with the upper left split into 3. As you get injured, you
count down toward death. The first quadrant is scratches and minor bruises and
such, the second is shallow cuts, third is deeper cuts and broken bones, fourth
is seriously debilitating injuries. Once you've got into the 4th quadrant,
you're a hair away from death.
