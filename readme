Apocalyptic Vignettes, a zombie apocalypse RPG.

You play yourself, with what you have on you right this moment, just as the
world starts to fall apart. You aren't the protagonist, you're the poor schmuck
standing 3 feet to the left of the Brad Pitt.

Powered by the Apocalypse, with a news mechanic for glimpsing bits and pieces of
things falling apart elsewhere.

At the beginning of the game, players roll a d20. The highest number is the
primary player character. They pat themselves down, look at the room they're in
and peek out the windows, and the game starts in that exact location. The game
takes place in the streets and city of whoever rolled highest.
