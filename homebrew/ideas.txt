Idea: a timer mechanic. I am thinking, ask the player about how far they are
from a hospital. The time that distance can be walked (or run) is about how long
they have for things to really fall to shit.

Suppose they say, 10 miles. Well, that's a pretty close hospital. 3 hours at a
walk, ~45 minutes at a run. Odds are, the hospital is also in the direction of
where the people are.

Idea: make each individual roll of the 3d6 have a meaning.

Maybe it can be like End of the World. Roll a 3+2+6=11, the action succeeds. But
the first roll is for trying, second for doing, third for consequence. They do
it, it succeeds, but leaves them worse off. Roll a 5+4+1=10, it succeeds but in
attempting it they fuck up something, no immediate bad consequence.

Or it can tell the GM how the outside world is doing. Say, any rolls <3 means
the apocalypse is getting closer. Any rolls >3 mean it's about the same.
